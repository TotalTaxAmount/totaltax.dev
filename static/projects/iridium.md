Iridium is a work in progress chess engine written in rust. I wanted to learn rust and I had been playing chess recently so I decided to build a chess bot from scratch. Right now I have all the backend stuff done, like keeping track of the position or the implementation of the UCI (Universal Chess Interface) protocol. I am working on debugging the search algorithem right now.
